## Sprite Creator

This project operates on a live-server using json endpoints. The user is able to create sprites by adding 4-frame horizontal pngs of their desired sprite image to a form, which is stored in db.json.

By selecting the sprite, the sprite is animated and the user is then able to interact with the sprite using the arrow keys.
